# Basic SQL Queries in a Notebook  
© ExploreAI Academy

## 📘 Overview

This project contains an introductory SQL notebook where we explore and query a sample database for a digital media company called **Chinook**. The Chinook database consists of multiple interrelated tables such as `artists`, `albums`, `media_tracks`, `invoices`, and `customers`.

The notebook is designed as part of a learning journey at ExploreAI Academy and is ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their SQL querying skills.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:

- ✅ Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve specific columns from tables in a SQLite database.
- ✅ Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter results based on conditions.
- ✅ Limit query outputs using the `LIMIT` clause.
- ✅ Combine multiple conditions using the `AND` keyword.

## 📁 Files Included
